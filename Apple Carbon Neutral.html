										<div><p><b>Apple have pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030.</b> To achieve this goal, 
										they will reduce their 2015 emissions (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) by 75% by 2030. 
										The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed 
										using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.</div></p>

										<div><p><b>I will be using data provided from Apple's Environmental Progress Reports to 
										visualize their progress towards becoming carbon neutral in 2030.</b></p></div>
										<br /> 
										<br /> 
										<!-- <div><p><u><b>D a s h b o a r d</b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>I built this dashboard using Power BI. I used line charts and a bar graph to clearly display 
										whether Apple will be carbon neutral by 2030. I used line charts as an effective way of 
										displaying changes over time, where I could clearly present Apple's emissions data each year. 
										Using a line chart also enabled me to utilise Power BI's forecast feature to show predictions 
										on whether Apple will meet their targets based on their past and present data. I then created a bar 
										chart to display the carbon footprint by each iPhone. This was a good visualization of how Apple have 
										reduced their carbon footprint gradually since 2017. I used a basic colour scheme throughout this report, 
										using purple and grey to keep the focus on the data, with hits of gold to showcase Apple's target emissions. </p></div>

										<div><p><u><b>F i n d i n g s </b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>Apple are currently <b>ahead of target</b> in their 2030 goal of <b>reducing their greenhouse gas 
										emissions</b> by 75% to 9m. As of 2022, they have already reduced their emissions by 47% to 20m. At this 
										current rate it is forecasted that Apple will have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 86% to 5m by 2030.
										</p></div>

										<div><p>However Apple are currently <b>behind target</b> in their 2030 goal of <b>carbon offsetting 25% of their 
										emissions</b>. As of 2023, Apple had only carbon offsetted 1m of carbon emissions. Although this is currently 
										behind target of offsetting 9m carbon emissions by 2030, Apple can choose to hit this target almost instantly 
										at any moment up until 2030 by investing in environmental projects around the world.
										</p></div>

										<div><p>Apple's carbon footprint by phone can be looked at in two ways. A positive is that 
										Apple have <b>reduced the carbon footprint of their phones by 29% since 2017</b>. However if we look at the full 
										dataset a more negative take arises. Although the carbon footprint has reduced since 2017, the 2023 iPhone 
										still has a bigger carbon footprint than the 2015 iPhone.
