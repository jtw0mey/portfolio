										<div><p><b>For this project I will be playing the role of an Analytics Consultant hired by 
										the U.S. Department of Energy. I will need to consolidate and clean up raw data, and 
										create a dashboard or report to help understand patterns and trends around power outages
										in the U.S. between 2002 and 2023.</b></div></p>

										<div><p>I will be using real data provided by the U.S. Department of Energy that is publically available.
										</p></div>
										<br /> 
										<br /> 
										<div><p><u><b>D a t a &nbsp;&nbsp;  C l e a n i n g</b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>This was easily the biggest data cleaning project I have experienced. The original data set 
										was seperated by individual year from 2002 - 2023, with each year using different formatting, different header 
										layouts and different columns.</div></p>

										<div><p>There were multiple variations of time formats in the original dataset that I needed to transform in to a 
										standardized and uniform format. We see "12:00 p.m.", "noon", "12 noon" amongst other variations. I started by using 
										the <em>split</em> function to seperate any columns that had date and time in the same cell. I would then like to 
										set all times to the 24hr clock (hh:mm) so all noon dates would be "12:00". I started by using <em>find & replace</em> 
										&nbsp;to find any cells with "noon" and replace with "12:00". For any cells with "p.m." in, I again used <em>find & replace</em> 
										&nbsp;to replace "p.m." with "PM". I was then able to change the number format in Excel to hh:mm which converted it to the 24hr 
										clock. The same process was used for cells with "a.m.".</div></p>

										<div><p>There were also multiple variations of the date that I needed to transform to a standardized format.
										We see some dates as "d/m/y", and some as "m/d/y" as well as other variations like "March 04". I would like to 
										set all dates to the "d/m/y". I started by using <em>Text to Columns</em> &nbsp;to change any "m/d/y" to 
										"d/m/y". For dates that included text such as "March 04", I used <em>Split</em>&nbsp; to seperate the month 
										and the day. I then used the formula <em>=MONTH(DATEVALUE(cell&"1"))</em> &nbsp;which turns the month text in to its 
										corresponding number. E.g. "March" was converted to "3". I then rejoined the day, month and year in correct order.</div></p>

										<div><p>The Type of Disturbance column had a wide variety of answers that needed to be catergorized. I catergorized 
										each type of disturbance in to one of thirteen catergories based on the Department of Energy's 2023 customer survey. This was 
										great for analyzing the data as the hundreds of different specific answers for disturbances such as weather were now all categorized 
										together. E.g. "Hurricane", "Extreme Weatherstorm", "Heavy rain and snowfall" were now all categrorized as "Weather or Natural 
										Disaster".</div></p>

										<div><p>The NERC region columns also needed to be cleaned due to the regions having changed over time between 2002 and 2023. 
										I used <em>find & replace</em> &nbsp;again to replace the old regions with the updated 2023 regions.</div></p>

										<div><p>I also added a new column for Event Duration by calculating the difference between when the power outage began, and 
										when it was restored. I used this data to visualize the average restoration time in each Region and State.</p></div>
										<br /> 
										<br /> 
										<!-- <div><p><u><b>D a s h b o a r d</b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>I built this dashboard in five sections: Customer's Affected, Number of Power Outages, Causes of Power Outages, 
										Megawatts Loss and Restoration Time. I kept a consistent colour scheme throughout this report, with each region's data
										matching the colour of that region from the NERC region map found at the top of the report.</p></div>

										<div><p>For the <em>Customer's Affected</em> &nbsp;section I started by creating a line chart to show the number of customer's 
											affected in each region over time from 2002 - 2023. I then created a bar chart to get an overall show of the total customer's 
											affected in each region. I finished this section with a vertical bar chart showing the states with the most customer's affected, 
											alongside a filled map to visualize this which I created on Tableau.</p></div>

											<div><p>For the <em>Causes of Power Outages</em> &nbsp;section I created two line charts showing weather versus non-weather
											related power outages. The top line chart shows how about half of all power outages are weather related. The bottom line 
											graph shows that of all large power outages (affecting over 50,000 people), weather is the cause of 96% of them.
											</p></div>
											<div><p>I also created pie charts for each NERC region to show the causes of power outages in each specific region. This 
											was also another way of effectively showing the domincance of weather related power outages.

											<div><p>For the <em>Restoration Time</em> &nbsp;section I produced a bar chart and vertical chart for region and US states again 
											to keep a consistent theme in my report. The bar chart shows the restoration time in each NERC region. The vertical bar chart shows 
											which US states' experience the longest restoration time. In this section I also added an additional bar chart showing the average 
											restoration time by each year. This was a good visualization of how the restoration has been gradually decreasing over time.

											<div><p><u><b>F i n d i n g s</b></u>
											<br /> 
											<div><p><em>Weather or Natural Disaster</em> &nbsp;is the cause of 46% of all power outages in the US. This goes up to a staggering 96% with 
											large power outages that affect over 50,000 people. This is clearly the biggest problem to the Department of Energy. 
											Although you can not control the weather, they could integrate a more weather resistant system. An underground electrical 
											system would go a long way in mitigating the power outages caused by weather.</p></div>

											<div><p>The total <em>Megawatts Loss</em> comes in at 1.04 million megawatts, this highlight the need to upgrade the current system to 
											one that reduces this amount of electricity that is going to waste. The majority of Megawatts Loss has come from SERC (374k) and WECC (312k), 
											which suggests these region's infrastructure may be the most outdated.</p></div>

											<div><p>The biggest <em>States Affected</em> were California, Texas and Michigan. These should be the highest priority for the Department of Energy. 
											All 3 states were in the top 9 states in Number of Customers Affected, Number of Power Outages, Amount of Megawatts Loss and Average Restoration Time. 
											This geographical data is good for identifying weak spots where the Department of Energy may want to focus their resources.</p></div>

											<div><p>The average <em>Restoration Time</em> was a good display of how the response to power outages has improved over time. The Average in 
											2002 was 69 hours, where as in 2023 that had dropped down to an average of just 8 hours for a power outage to be restored. This shows how the 
											regions have been able to respond to the power outages more efficiently.</p></div>
