										<div><p>I will be <b>using historical stock market data from S&P 500 between 2014 - 2017 to create a 
										dashboard</b> visualising the stock's busiest date, busiest day of the week, and which company has had 
										the most stock traded. I will then take a closer look at Amazon's stock, displaying the stock's volatility 
										and finding out which date was the most volatile.</div></p> 
										<br /> 
										<br /> 
										<!-- <p><u><b>D a s h b o a r d</b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>I built this dashboard using Tableau. I used line charts and a bar graph to clearly display 
										the trade volume by stock and day of week. I used a line chart for the volume by date, as it 
										is great for displaying changes over time, and I was easily able to show which date had the highest trade volume.<br />
										For the busiest day of the week and for the company with the most stock traded, I created bar charts to clearly show 
										which catergory's had the most volume traded. I used a blue colour gradient to further emphasize which bars in the charts had 
										the largest volume.<br />  
										For Amazon's volatility, I was able to create a candlestick graph, which displays the relationship 
										between Amazon's high, low, opening, and closing prices. This was great for visualising volatility 
										with the biggest candle bar showing which day was the most volatile.</div></p> 
										<br /> 
										<br /> -->
										<p><u><b>F i n d i n g s</b></u>
										<br /> 
										<div><p>The date with the <b>largest trade volume is 24th August 2015 with 4.6 billion trades</b> taking place 
										on the S&P500 stock market, well above the daily average of 2.1 billion. This was due to one of the biggest 'flash 
										crashes' of recent times, where a very rapid and volatile fall in security prices happen. On 24th August 
										2015, the S&P500 opened at 1965.15 and dropped by 5% to 1867.01 within minutes. This led to traders panic 
										buying and selling causing the massive trade volume.
										</div></p> 

										<div><p>On the 24th August 2015, the stocks that were traded most was <b>Bank of America Corp (BAC) with 215 million 
										trades</b> and <b>Apple (AAPL) with 162 million trades</b>. These two stocks combined made up 8% of the total stock traded 
										on the S&P500 market on this date.
										</div></p> 

										<div><p>The day of the week where trade volume is highest is <b>Wednesday with 442 billion trades</b>. All days 
										of the week have a similar level of trade volumes apart from Monday with 374 billion trades. This may be due 
										to traders waiting for more market information after the weekend.
										</div></p> 

										<div><p>Amazon (AMZN) stock's volatility was at its highest on 9th June 2017. On this date we see the stock price 
										reach a high of 1013, and a low of 927, a difference of 86. The candestick chart is a good visualization of this 
										volatility with the red bar on this date being the largest on the graph.
